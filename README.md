# ESP8266-NodeMCU-Custom-Clock
It's a clock that I made from ESP8266 NodeMCU. It syncs the time from the web using WiFi. It even supports custom messages!

**Extra things you will need:**
-Four 7-segment displays (Cathode type)
-Four IC74273 (1 for each display)
-A tactile switch
-A 10k resistor
-Two breadboards
-Lots of jumper cables
